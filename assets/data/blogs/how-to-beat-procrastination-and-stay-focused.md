    Procrastination isn’t laziness; it’s *avoidance of discomfort*. Make starting painless and momentum will do the rest.

    ## Make It Easy to Start

| Problem | Make It Smaller | First 2-Minute Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scared of a big chapter | One subheading only | Open book, write 3 bullets |
| Dreading an essay | Outline before paragraphs | Write 5 rough ideas |
| Avoiding math | 10-minute warm-up set | Solve 2 easy questions |


## Focus Tricks


- The 10/10 Rule: 10 minutes on, then decide if you’ll continue (you usually will).
- Visual timers: seeing time pass keeps you honest.
- Environment reset: tidy desk, remove the one biggest distraction.

> Action beats anxiety. Start tiny, finish strong.
