    Exams are easier when the *process* is kind. Make your prep gentle and consistent.

    ## The Calm Prep Plan

| Phase | Focus | Example Activities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Understand | Get the big picture | Skim syllabus, map topics |
| Practice | Test yourself often | Past papers, short quizzes |
| Polish | Tidy weak spots | Error log, mini-lessons |


## Energy Matters


- Sleep like itâ€™s part of the exam (because it is).
- Snack simply: water + fruit or nuts.
- Schedule a real day offâ€”recovery is productive.

> Peace is a study skill.
