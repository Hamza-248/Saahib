    If you’ve ever wondered how top students keep winning, it’s usually not about being “born smart.”
    It’s about tiny, repeatable habits done consistently. Try these and make them your own.

    ## 10 Habits That Actually Stick

| Habit | Why it Works | Try This |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Plan tomorrow tonight | Reduces morning stress | Write 3 Must-Do tasks before bed |
| Active recall | Forces your brain to remember | Close the book—explain the idea out loud |
| Spaced repetition | Moves info to long-term memory | Review after 1, 3, 7 days |
| Focused blocks | Protects deep work time | 25–50 min study, 5–10 min break |
| One inbox | Less mental clutter | Keep all tasks in one app/notebook |
| Teach it | Exposes gaps | Explain to a friend or to your wall |
| Past papers | Builds exam fluency | Practice under real timing |
| Sleep first | Consolidates memory | Aim for 7–8 hours |
| Healthy defaults | Saves willpower | Water bottle, nuts/fruit on desk |
| Reflect weekly | Course-corrects early | 15-min Sunday review |


## Mini Checklist


- Did I plan my top 3 tasks?
- Did I test myself (not just re-read)?
- Did I protect one deep-work block today?

> Small habits, repeated often, beat all-nighters every time.
