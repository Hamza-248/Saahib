    Past papers aren’t just practice—they’re x-rays of the exam. Use them to see patterns, timing, and traps.

    ## Your Past Paper System

| Step | What You Do | Why It Helps |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scan | Skim 3–5 papers quickly | Spot repeat topics and formats |
| Simulate | Do a full timed paper | Build stamina + timing |
| Study | Mark with the scheme | Learn what earns marks |
| Summarize | Log mistakes in a table | Turn errors into lessons |


## Error Log Template

| Question | My Mistake | Correct Idea | Fix Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Q2 (MCQ) | Rushed, misread 'except' | Underline qualifiers | Slow down on 'not/except' |
| Q5 (Math) | Skipped unit | Always write units | Add 'units?' to checklist |


> Practice doesn’t make perfect—*feedback* does.
