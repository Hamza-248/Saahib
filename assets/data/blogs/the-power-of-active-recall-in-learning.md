    Active recall is simply this: *close the book and try to remember*. It feels harder than re-reading—
    and that’s exactly why it works.

    ## 3 Easy Ways to Use It Today

| Method | What You Do | Good For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Flashcards | One question, one answer | Definitions, formulas, vocab |
| Blur / Cover | Hide notes, write from memory | Diagrams, lists, steps |
| Teach Back | Explain to someone else | Concepts and processes |


## Quick Routine


1. Read once to understand.
2. Close your notes.
3. Write or say everything you remember.
4. Check—then fix gaps.

> Learning happens when your brain has to work for it.
