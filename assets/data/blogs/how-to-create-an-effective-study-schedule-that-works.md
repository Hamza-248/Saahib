    A good study plan is less about perfection and more about rhythm. Build a light, flexible week you can actually follow.

    ## Plug-and-Play Weekly Template

| Day | Core Subject | Skill/Practice | Light Review |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mon | Math | Problem sets (timed) | Key formulas |
| Tue | English | Essay planning | Vocab review |
| Wed | Science | Labs/diagrams | Concept map |
| Thu | History | Source analysis | Dates/people |
| Fri | Weakest area | Targeted drills | Quick recap |
| Sat | Past papers | Mock under exam timing | Error log |
| Sun | Rest + prep | Plan next week | Pack bag |


## How to Keep It Flexible


- Schedule buffers (they save you when life happens).
- Batch small tasks (reply, file, tidy) into one slot.
- Move sessions, don’t cancel them—shift, don’t skip.

> Plans don’t have to be pretty; they have to be lived.
