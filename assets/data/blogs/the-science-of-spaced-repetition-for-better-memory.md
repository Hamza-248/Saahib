    Your brain loves patterns. Spaced repetition uses *when* you review to lock information in for the long run.

    ## A Simple Spacing Plan

| Review # | When | What to Do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Same day | Quick recall, no notes |
| 2 | Day 3 | Flashcards / blur method |
| 3 | Day 7 | Short quiz from memory |
| 4 | Day 21 | Mixed practice + past questions |


## Build a Personal Memory Deck


- Turn mistakes into cards for review.
- Mix easy and hard questions—variety boosts recall.
- Track leeches: items you always forget need re-writing, not re-reading.

> It’s not how long you study—it’s *when* you review.
