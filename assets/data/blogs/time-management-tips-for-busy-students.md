    You don’t need more hours—you need fewer leaks. Here’s how to keep your time from slipping away.

    ## The 3B Method: Blocks, Batching, Boundaries

| Tool | How It Works | Starter Move |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Blocks | Protect focus time in your calendar | Two 45-min blocks daily |
| Batching | Group similar tasks together | Messages 2x/day only |
| Boundaries | Decide what you *won’t* do | No phone on desk during blocks |


## Tiny Wins That Add Up


- Put your bag and bottle by the door at night.
- Use "Do Not Disturb" during deep work.
- Write shorter to-do lists—3 big rocks beat 12 pebbles.

> If everything is urgent, nothing is important.
