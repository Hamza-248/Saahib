    MCQs look easy until the clock starts. Here’s how to play the game well and fairly.

    ## The MCQ Playbook

| Move | When to Use It | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Predict first | Before seeing options | Answer in your head, then check |
| Eliminate aggressively | Two options look similar | Cross out obvious distractors |
| Qualifiers matter | Words like 'always', 'except' | Underline, slow down |
| Flag + move | Stuck at 40 seconds | Return after easy wins |


## Timing Drill


- 20 questions • 22 minutes.
- Aim for ~60 seconds each, bank extra time for tough ones.
- Final sweep: check qualifiers and units.

> Accuracy first, speed follows.
