    Notes aren’t a transcript—they’re a *thinking tool*. Capture the big ideas and how they connect.

    ## Pick a Style for the Job

| Method | Best For | Tip |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cornell | Lectures and revision | Write cues + summary after class |
| Outline | Structured topics | Indent to show hierarchy |
| Mind Map | Ideas + connections | Use arrows and simple icons |
| Flow Notes | Understanding concepts | Write in your own words |


## Make Notes You’ll Actually Re-Read


- Headings, white space, and short sentences.
- One highlight color for *definitions*, one for *examples*.
- End each page with a 2–3 line summary.

> If your notes teach *you*, they can teach *anyone*.
